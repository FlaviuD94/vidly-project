In this project I imported a list of movies from a fake server / JSON format file.</br>
I created 3 components: Like, Movie and Movies.</br>
Like component is a toggler that displays if the user liked or not the movie. This data comes from the fake server.</br>
Movie component was created in a table format based on the data received from the JSON file and I have add a delete button and the like icon.</br>
In the Movies component I have put the movie state, and two handle functions for like and delete. </br>Both functions are manipulating the data from the fake server in order to display everything dynamically.
